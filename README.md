Hi, this is a movies-app!

I. To run successfully, you need to mount the docker image, which can be found
here https://hub.docker.com/r/webbylabhub/movies

1. Enter the command to copy the imagedocker "pull webbylabhub/movies".
2. Enter the command to run image "docker run --name movies -p 8000:8000
   webbylabhub/movies"

Congratulations, the server part is ready to use!

II. To successfully run a frontend, go to the site where the running application
is already compiled https://imv-movie-app.netlify.app/ , or follow the image
here
